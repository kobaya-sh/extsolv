This Main Version is mm.16.6(unstable).

This version CAN
  + Single point calculation of MM energy
  + Single point calculation of MM force
  + Periodic boundery condition
  + Periodic boundery condition with Ewald Sum
  + Periodic boundery condition with Direct Sum ( need to modify main.f90 )
  + Periodic boundery condition with Particle Mesh Ewald ( Energy & FORCE )
  + Periodic boundery condition with for parallelepiped cell
  + electronic/mechanical embedding ( switched by is_ee )
This version CANNOT
  - Optimize structure
  - Molecular dynamics
  - use as QM/MM calculation interface
  - handle link atom
Fixed bug
  * erfc in x < 1.4 ( asymptotic expansion -> global approximation )
  * function fm ( in pme )
  * pme ( about FFT )
  * pme ( about excluded atoms )
  * moment ( gravity point )
  11.2+ TK & TEQ in bend.f90 ( memory allocation error )
  11.2+ ONE_SCEE & ONE_SCNB in nb14.f90 ( index error )
  12.0+ e_lj and e_coulomb in nonbon.f90 ( initialization error )
  12.0+ direct Coulomb sum in debug_ewald ( coefficient for reprica; 1.0->0.5 )
  14.2+ ( NOT TESTED ) Hydrogen bond calculation in nonbon.f90 and nb14.f90 ( added )
  15.0+ call subroutine pbc before calculate r_ijn in pme.f90.
  15.0+ inclement of p_numex in pme.f90 ( If j==0, p_numex was not inclemented. )
Other Modification
  12.1+ Fast Interpolation in pme.f90 ( use fm.f90 )
  14.0+ Change of FFT library ( use fft.f90, my library )
        -> Any size of grid is allowed ( but got slow a little, maybe. )
  14.1+ Remove "common" statement from prmtop.inc
  15.2+ Change of FFT library ( FFTW3 )
        -> large impact to speed
  15.2+ fm.f90 was optimized. This update would cause a little difference
        from previous versions.
  15.4+ clock.f90 was added.
  16.6+ bond, bend, tors was separated.
  16.6+ mmcounter.inc was removed.
  16.6+ dipole.f90 was fixed.
  16.6+ prmtop_r.f90 was changed to be generated from prmtop_r.sh.
  16.6+ tors.f90 pme.f90 and fm.f90 was optimized.
  16.6+ excluded in pme was merged into nonbon.f90.
  16.7+ pbc is applied to bond vector.
  16.7+ (optional) guess_eta was added.
  16.8+ fm was fixed.
  16.9+ eta-guessing subroutine was added.
  16.11+ term-wise force is not calculated.
        (total force is the only results.)
